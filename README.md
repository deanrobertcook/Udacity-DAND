# Udacity-DAND

This repo contains the work I did while going through Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) (DAND). The main project I submitted were:

- tmdb_movies
- ab_test

Most of the work here has been done in Jupiter notebooks.

## TODO

Create a list of resources gathered during the course that helped with understanding core topics
