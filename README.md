# Udacity-DAND

This repo contains the work I did while going through Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) (DAND). The main projects I submitted so far are found in the following directories:

- tmdb_movies
- ab_test

All of the work here has been done in Jupiter notebooks.

The directories marked "\_playground" have generally just been for trying out different packages in the python data ecosystem and are generally much more poorly documented.

## TODO

- Create a list of resources gathered during the course that helped with understanding core topics
